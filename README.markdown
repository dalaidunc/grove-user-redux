# User Management in Redux

This Redux module for user authentication forms part of the MarkLogic Grove project. In addition to client state management, it handles API calls to a Grove middle-tier. See the [reference application](https://github.com/marklogic-community/grove-react-template) for an example of using this library in practice.

## Install

    npm install @marklogic-community/grove-user-redux --save
