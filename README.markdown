# User Management in Redux

This Redux module for user authentication forms part of the MarkLogic Grove project. In addition to client state management, it handles API calls to a Grove middle-tier. See the [reference application](https://project.marklogic.com/repo/projects/NACW/repos/grove-react-template/browse) for an example of using this library in practice. 

## Install

    npm install grove-user-redux --save
